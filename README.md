**Project** : Caching Search Results for Offline Access

# Overview
This project demos using Realm to store search results into a local cache.  The ids of the results are stored locally and the flexible sync subscription is updated to synchronize to any new ids that have been added.  Offline searches for previously searched for terms will still function.
